However, Baywatch has just hit Netflix and found new success on the streaming service, climbing up to No. 8 on the global charts for the week of Oct. 28 to Nov. 3. The film was one of the three releases this week after the slasher Time Cut and Martha Stewart's documentary Martha, and hit the eighth spot with 4.1 million views, or 7.9 hours viewed. Although Johnson's 2017 comedy action film found new success on streaming, it was not popular with the critics.

When was the last time audiences had a film recreate the slapstick and heart of Home Alone, or tug on the heartstrings in all the right places like Love Actually? Well, if moviegoers were relying on Red One to be the Christmas classic for a new generation, they may have to look elsewhere, at least according to the first reviews to drop on Rotten Tomatoes. The Dwayne Johnson and Chris Evans holiday effort is currently being left with a lump of coal in its Christmas stocking.

Some reviews comment on how empty it all feels, despite its big production values. Dan Bayer of Next Big Picture writes, "Not every film has to be art, but it'd be nice if they could make a product that had more life to it than this empty exercise in Christmas franchise starting." Other critics point to its lack of holiday spirit, with Peter Gray of The Au Review writing, "For a movie centered around the festive season and attempts to drive home the importance of joy, there's very little on offer when it comes to the unnecessarily long 122 minutes of Red One." Edward Doughlas of The Weekend Warrior doubles down on this by saying, "Possibly one of the most misguided holiday movies ever made. Instead of putting you into the Xmas spirit, it makes you feel as if you've been force-fed a giant lump of coal."

It might not be the holidays yet, but Amazon MGM want you to hang up your stockings early for Red One , the high-concept caper starring Dwayne Johnson, Chris Evans, and JK Simmons. Johnson plays the role he was born for: a hulking head of security to Simmons' Santa Claus, who is disillusioned with humanity's lack of goodness, and one day from retirement.

Like Jumanji: Welcome To The Jungle, which Johnson collaborated on with Red One director Jake Kasdan, the festive adventure aims for action comedy. When Santa is kidnapped, Johnson's inexplicably immortal Callum Drift teams up with Level 4 Naughty Lister Jack O'Malley (Evans), who is a master thief, hacker, and somehow has had the superpower of being able to find people or things since childhood. Don't worry, that's not really important enough to be explained beyond it helping the plot lurch forward.

Dwayne Johnson and Chris Evans teaming up in a festive adventure from Jake Kasdan, director of two extremely successful Jumanji movies, sounds like a recipe for a Christmas cracker.

Unfortunately, Red One ends up more of a festive flop.

Released a week earlier in UK cinemas than in the US (presumably to ensure a streaming release on Prime Video this Christmas), Red One reimagines the North Pole as a well-drilled operation with its own security team, led by Callum Drift (Johnson). His only directive is to keep Santa Claus (JK Simmons), code name Red One, safe.

Red One box office collection

Baywatch is one of the most famous TV shows of all time and has since reached cult classic status. In 2017, the TV show was turned into a film starring Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson and Zac Efron, and it was one of Johnson's most disappointing projects.

Dwayne Johnson in Red Notice | Netflix

Red One, his newly released action-comedy has made critics and fans question whether his star power is now fading, and it is even enough to carry a film to success. With his previous lackluster performances, and the recent movie also being a letdown, the road ahead looks quite rocky for The Rock (pun intended).

A dark web Scrooge and an elite ELF commando must save Santa Claus, and Christmas, and even everyone on the naughty list in Red One, opening in Prague and cinemas worldwide this weekend. A knowing sense of humor and some appealing performances can’t save the inherent cynicism in this would-be blockbuster’s overstuffed script, and some downright ugly visuals make the film look like it was filtered through coal, even in IMAX. Bah, humbug!

Red One stars Chris Evans as Jack O’Malley, who never believed in Santa and spoils the magic of Christmas for his cousins as a child in an opening flashback. Thirty years later, he’s a deadbeat dad who can’t be bothered to pick up son Dylan (Wesley Kimmel—son of Jimmy) from school while he recovers from a hangover.

Jack is also a degenerate gambler and cybercriminal known as The Wolf who steals a lollipop from a baby on his way back from breaking into a government facility on behalf of his unknown dark web client, who might as well be a terrorist. This guy sucks—and yet Evans is entirely engaging, getting a rare chance to dig into his native Boston accent while expressing complete befuddlement at everything that’s about to come his way.

That everything includes all the creatures overseen by MORA (Mythological Oversight and Restoration Authority), the secret authority that has been managing witches, trolls, goblins, and yes, even Santa Claus (J.K. Simmons) from the North Pole for the past hundreds of years. MORA director (Lucy Liu) manages teams of little bunny-goblin elves, a talking polar bear (Reinaldo Faberlle), Santa’s gigantic reindeer, and an elite squad of Enforcement, Logistics and Fortification (ELF) agents led by Callum (Dwayne Johnson), who happens to be currently facing a crisis of cheer.

So where can you Watch Red One? Is it on HBO Max? What about 𝙽etflix? Here’s how to Watch the Red One epic starring 2024 Latest English and Hindi Sub Mo𝚟ies.

When Is Red One Release Date?

Yes, Red One will be released exclusively in theaters on June 28, 2024. Originally, the Mo𝚟ie was expected to be released on June 28, 2024, but was then pushed to November 4, 2024, and again to June 28, 2024, with these delays ultimately being caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Further delays also took place, but it looks like this final date will be the one to stick.
